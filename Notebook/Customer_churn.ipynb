    "**Objective Business:** The main aim of Vodafone Corporation is to decrease the rate of customer attrition, a common issue in many industries, particularly telecommunications. The ultimate goal is to predict the probability of a customer discontinuing their service, pinpoint the main factors contributing to customer attrition, and devise strategies to retain customers and prevent this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Current Situation:** At present, Vodafone has customer data at its disposal, provided by the business development unit and the marketing and sales team. This data will be utilized to construct machine learning models to forecast customer attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Mining Goals:** The objective of data mining in this context is to create a classification model that can predict if a customer is likely to discontinue their service. This is a supervised learning problem where the model will learn from the provided data and make predictions on new data. The model should also be capable of identifying the key attributes or indicators that lead to customer attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Plan:** The project plan would involve data preparation for analysis, selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms for model construction, model training and testing, evaluation of the model’s performance, and finally, deployment of the model for predicting customer attrition. The key indicators identified by the model can then be used to formulate effective strategies for customer retention."
